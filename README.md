The “Restaurant Management System” is a very common program used in restaurants. The main aim is to perform basic functions to automate what a waiter does. As the name of the project suggests, the project is about billing but it also covers the job of a waiter who takes the order, as the program will show the menu as well, which will make users select an item to order and side by side the billing will be performed.
